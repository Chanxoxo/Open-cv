# OpenCV-Mini-Projects
**Computer vision** is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.”

**OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)** is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source BSD license.

Here are some projects & their applications which can be build using openCV:-

## 1. Face Blur

Use GaussianBlur with a kernel of (91,91) to blur faces. It can be used for Privacy & Identity Protection in public/private areas. Can increase or decrease blur strength by changing the kernel.

## 2. Color Transfer

Used one image color (source) to change the color of different image (target) using both Color Transfer Algorithm as well as color_transfer modules. It can be used to apply different types of color filters.

## 3. Live Sketch

convert an image or a video into a sketch.

## 4. Extract Faces From An Image

Simple python program to extract faces from an image. It can be used in a face recognition app to improve accuracy.

## 5. Color Detection

Color detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. Color detection is necessary to recognize objects, it is also used as a tool in various image editing and drawing apps. Some Real-world Applications:-

- In self-driving car, to detect the traffic signals.
- Multiple color detection is used in some industrial robots, to performing pick-and-place task in separating different colored objects.

## 6. Virtual Paint

This code helps you track an object-of-interest to draw colored lines on the screen (just like the Paint application but using the webcam).

## 7. Number Plate Detection
