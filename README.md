# OpenCV-Mini-Projects
**Computer vision** is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.”



## 1. Face Blur

Use GaussianBlur with a kernel of (91,91) to blur faces. It can be used for Privacy & Identity Protection in public/private areas. Can increase or decrease blur strength by changing the kernel.

## 2. Color Transfer

Used one image color (source) to change the color of different image (target) using both Color Transfer Algorithm as well as color_transfer modules. It can be used to apply different types of color filters.

## 3. Live Sketch

Convert one image into a sketch.
